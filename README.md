# Music_Player
Python-based music player app based on code provided by codespeedy.com(https://www.codespeedy.com/build-a-music-player-with-tkinter-and-pygame-in-python/).

Farther along I hope to add support for downloading audio tracks from the internet and syncing them to a separate mp3 player device connected to the computer through USB.
